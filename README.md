* CodeBook.md  
This file describes the original data set and the transformations applied to fulfill the assignment, ending in the generation of the file tidy_dataset.txt.

* run_analysis.R

Other than the comments in the file itself, the steps are explained in CodeBook.md.

* tidyTable.txt  
File containing the final tidy dataset, generated by run_analysis.R through

       allDataMelted <- melt(allData, id.vars =  c("subject", "activities"))
       allDataMean <- dcast(allDataMelted, subject + activities ~ variable, mean)

       write.table(allDataMean, file = "./tidyTable.txt", sep = ",", row.names = FALSE)
